# alnvdl/workspace

This repo contains my personal templates for GitHub Codespaces.

The basic configuration (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) does not clone any
repositories (other than this one) and can be used for spinning up one-off
codespaces for testing things or playing with ideas.

The `alnvdl` configuration (`.devcontainer/alnvdl/devcontainer.json`) builds
upon the basic configuration and sets up a pre-configured development
environment with a bunch of the repositories I have most recently worked on.
